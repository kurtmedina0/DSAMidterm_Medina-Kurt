## Introduction

React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. React allows developers to create large, complex web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

## Installation

To get started with React, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download Node.js, which includes npm, from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

Once Node.js and npm are installed, install the **create-react-app** tool:
```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

## Creating a New React Project 

To create a new React application, use create-react-app. This tool sets up a new React project with a basic structure and configuration.
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```
