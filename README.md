Introduction to React
React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast, interactive user interfaces for web applications. It uses a component-based approach to create reusable UI components, making it easier to build scalable applications. React also employs a Virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance.

Key Features of React.js
1. Component-Based Architecture
React apps are built with components, which are reusable and encapsulated units of code that manage their own content, styles, and behavior. This modular approach makes code easier to manage and test.
2. JSX (JavaScript XML)
React uses JSX, a syntax that combines JavaScript and HTML. It allows you to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript, making it more intuitive to create and organize UI components.
3. Virtual DOM
React uses a virtual representation of the DOM (Document Object Model), which allows for efficient updates and rendering. Only the components that have changed are re-rendered, enhancing performance.
4. State and Props Management
State is used to manage data within a component, while props are used to pass data from one component to another. Together, they allow React components to handle dynamic data and create interactive UIs.
5. Unidirectional Data Flow
React enforces a one-way data flow, making it predictable and easier to debug. This helps maintain a clear and manageable structure for large applications.
6. Component Lifecycle Methods
React components have lifecycle methods that allow you to hook into different stages of a component's existence. This is useful for handling data fetching, subscriptions, and cleaning up resources.
